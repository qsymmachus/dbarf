        <span class="bold">Net Control:</span> This is <span class="italic">[CALL SIGN]</span> in
        <span class="italic">[LOCATION]</span>, serving as Net Control for this week’s DBARF social net.
        Alternate Net Control is <span class="italic">[CALL SIGN]</span> in <span class="italic">[LOCATION]</span>.
        Before we begin, if there is any emergency traffic, go ahead now.

      <p>
        <span class="bold">Net Control:</span> Emergency traffic receives priority at all times during 
        the net. (Hearing none thank God,) let us begin. DBARF is the Distributed Bay Area Radio Fellowship,
        a nationwide network of Allstar Link nodes established by a group of friends, originally licensed
        in the San Francisco Bay Area, but since dispersed across these United States. Our hub station is
        KN6 DPT in Burlington, Vermont, Allstar node #5-1-8-6-5.
      </p>

      <p>
        The club maintains a website with more information at dbarf.club <span class="italic">
        [repeat in phonetics].</span> In addition to our weekly social nets, we also hold ad hoc nets during
        news and sporting events of major significance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our social net convenes weekly on Monday nights, at 5:30 pm Pacific, 8:30 pm Eastern.
        All licensed  stations are welcome and encouraged to join the net. We will first take check-ins from members
        of DBARF, followed by guest check-ins.  Members of the network, please check in now with your call sign and
        location.
      </p>

      <p class="italic">
        [Gather all member check ins, repeating their call signs and locations.]
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="bold">Net Control:</span> Guest stations, please check in now.

      <p>
        <span class="bold">Net Control:</span> Unless otherwise indicated, DBARF nets operate in a
        round-robin format, clockwise around the country, though this order can be interrupted at any
        time by calling a specific station or Net Control at the end of your transmission, or by emergency 
        traffic between transmissions. Before a station transmits, we ask that you allow your node to drop 
        the carrier, and that you pause briefly. There is no need to repeat your call sign again for the 
        duration of the net - every ten minutes, at the automated reminder, Net Control will repeat the 
        call signs of all present. 
      </p>

      <h2>Tips for Net Control</h2>

      <h3>Before the net</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Prepare at least 3 new phonetic versions of your call-sign, for lulz.</li>
        <li>Prepare at least two social questions or contests/trivia rounds.</li>
        <li>Establish and alternate net control.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>During the net</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          If you failed to establish an alternate, request that one station volunteer at the beginning of 
          the net, likely after guest check-ins.
        </li>
        <li>Remember to quickly recite the call signs of all stations in attendance at the ten-minute
          reminder tones.
        </li>
      </ul>
